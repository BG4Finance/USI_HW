### Università della Svizzera italiana, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland

Here you can find a repository for my coding works as individual and/or as group.
I will upload here, from time to time, my future projects.

At Università della Svizzera italiana we started using Python to solve Machine Learning problems through Neural Networks.
Now I am appying what I learned to different financial challenges, on more or less realistic scenarios to advance my coding skills.

Feel free to use the contnet of this repository. 
In case credit me as well.
